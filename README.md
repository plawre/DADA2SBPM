# Parker's Stacked Bar Plot for Taxonomic Data Makerer

This Shiny web application allows users to create stacked bar plots for taxonomic data from DADA2 ASV (Amplicon Sequence Variant) tables. Users can upload an ASV abundance table in Excel format, select taxonomic levels for filtering and plotting, and generate visually appealing plots representing the relative abundance of different taxa. The application also handles sequences without taxonomic information by labeling them as "Other" and plotting them in gray.

## Features

- Upload DADA2 ASV abundance tables in Excel format.
- Filter data based on selected taxonomic levels.
- Plot data at different taxonomic levels (e.g., Domain, Phylum, Class).
- Display individual ASVs as smaller boxes within the bars representing taxa.
- Save generated plots as PNG files.
